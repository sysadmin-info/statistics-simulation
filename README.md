**  Author: Sysadmin                                                                                            *
** How much will I earn in a year depending on what happens.                                                    *
** 1) Monthly earnings - fixed income 4500 USD - normal distribution                                            *
** 2) Monthly expenses - distribution by interval - Gaussian distribution, average value 2000, deviation 1500   *
** 3) Termination of the employment contract - discrete distribution                                            *
** 4) Additional salary - on call (business phone from work in case of emergency                                *
** - taking action e.g. at night or at the weekend), overtime - a discrete distribution                         *
** 5) Change of the job - low probability (large earnings in the current company) / large change in salary,     *
** when it changes - 9000 USD - discrete distribution.                                                          *
** 6) Change of the department in current work - high probability 5000 USD  - discrete distribution             *
** 7) Graduation - very high probability - discrete distribution                                                *
** 8) Bank loan - average probability - discrete distribution                                                   *
** 9) Jackpot win - low probability - discrete distribution                                                     *
** Time: 12 months = 1 year                                                                                     *
** Measurements are made for 5000 samples.                                                                      *
** Maximum earnings are calculated for a value less than the minimum jackpot win.                               *
** Classes quantity = 30                                                                                        *
